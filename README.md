# Borealis Software Source Code
Welcome to the official GitHub page to the source code of all registered software in the Borealis Modern Free Open-Source Software (MFOSS) Project!
# Purpose of the Borealis Project
The purpose of the Borealis Project is that to make modern free open-source software (MFOSS) available to everyone in every corner in the world. Although the GNU Project is also directed to this idea, the GNU Project is now kind of outdated, and I thought we should make a project for MODERN and NEW software.
